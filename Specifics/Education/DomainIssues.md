# What are the key aspects?

## Key Issues (atleast in the US)
- Establish Trust
- Establish Feedback
- Durable Business Models
- Coding/Bootcamps lack large outcomes. Low cost of entry barriers for competing businesses.

## Business Models
- "Income Share Agreement" model being tried out, atleast in the US.   

  Education companies don't charge upfront fees but make it result-oriented by
  sharing the future income earned due to their course offering credit earned by the student. Perhaps by charging a fraction of salary earned over a few years.

- Learning by gaming concepts.   
Try gamification of learning techiques.
