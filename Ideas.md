## Improve Website Engagement
1. Our website should be not only be information packed, it also needs to be interactive and engaging.  
  1.1 For example, startup investors and wannabes should be allowed to pose questions that get answers from empannelled VCs and other investors.  
  1.2 To enable this, we invite expert investors to get empanneled on the website.  
2. We publish a list of startup themes/areas and invite wannabes and other founders to propose ideas around those themes.
3. We mention that the best ideas shortlisted by expert investors are called for face to face special events free at a special venue.
4. We create a startup discussion forum where people discuss all things related to the startup.
